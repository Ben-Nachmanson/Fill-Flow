Here’s the build plan. Ship the core first, then add stretch.
0) Outcome
* A public repo that deploys a mock trading service on Kubernetes with CI/CD, IaC, and full observability.
* One-click demo: run make demo or a Codespace. A Grafana dashboard shows traffic, latency, error rate, and “orders per second.”
1) Scope (Core)
* Service: trade-svc with REST + background workers.
    * POST /orders → validate → enqueue → simulate fill → persist → publish event.
    * GET /positions, /orders/:id, /healthz, /metrics (Prometheus).
* Data: Postgres tables orders(id,symbol,side,qty,price,status,ts), fills(order_id,price,qty,ts), positions(symbol,qty,avg_price).
* Eventing: Start with an internal queue (e.g., Redis Streams). Kafka/NATS is stretch.
* Price feed: Deterministic toy generator (random walk).
* Language: Go (Fiber/Gin + pgx) or Python (FastAPI + asyncpg). Choose one and commit.
2) Architecture
* API pod(s) → Redis Streams → worker pod(s).
* Postgres for state.
* Prometheus + Grafana for metrics. Loki (or EFK) for logs. Alertmanager for alerts.
* K8s objects: Deployments, Service, HPA, PDB, ConfigMap, Secret.
3) Repo layout

/ (mono-repo)
  /cmd/trade-svc
  /internal/{api,domain,storage,queue,pricing}
  /deploy/helm/{trade-svc,redis,postgres,prom-stack}
  /infra/terraform/{network,eks,rds}   # or k3d/local
  /ops/runbooks
  /dashboards/grafana.json
  /.github/workflows/{ci.yml,cd.yml}
  /Makefile
  /README.md
4) Local dev (day 1)
* Dev DB via Docker Compose.
* Run service locally. Seed symbols. Curl a POST to /orders. Confirm DB writes.
* Expose /metrics. Verify with Prometheus locally.
5) Containerization
* Multi-stage Dockerfile. Non-root user. Distroless if Go.
* Healthcheck. Graceful shutdown. Config via env.
6) CI (GitHub Actions)
* Jobs: lint, test, build, sast (gosec or bandit), docker-build-push (GHCR), helm-lint.
* Cache deps. Fail on coverage < 80%.
* Artifacts: image tag sha-<short>, helm chart package.
7) CD
* Simple path: helm upgrade --install to cluster on main.
* Stretch: GitOps with Argo CD app-of-apps.
8) Kubernetes (dev)
* Local: k3d or kind with make cluster-up.
* Namespaces: platform, trading.
* Resources:
    * trade-svc Deployment + HPA (CPU 70%, min 1 max 5).
    * Redis StatefulSet.
    * Postgres: use Bitnami Helm chart for dev.
    * PodDisruptionBudget for API.
    * NetworkPolicy baseline allow-from-namespace.
9) Observability
* Metrics: http_request_duration_seconds, orders_created_total, orders_filled_total, queue_lag_gauge, db_latency_ms, worker_errors_total.
* Dashboards: latency P50/P95/P99, RPS, error rate, queue lag, DB connections, CPU/mem, pod restarts.
* Alerts (Alertmanager):
    * HighErrorRate: >2% 5m.
    * HighLatency: P99 > 300ms 5m.
    * QueueLag: >1,000 10m.
    * DBConnHigh: >80% 10m.
* Logs: Loki. Save queries in repo.
10) Data + migrations
* Migrate tool (golang-migrate or Alembic). make migrate-up/down.
* Seed script for fake activity to drive dashboards.
11) IaC
* Local: Terraform for S3 backend + k3d bootstrap (or just Makefile).
* Cloud (stretch but valuable):
    * VPC, EKS, RDS Postgres, Elasticache Redis (or MSK for Kafka if you choose it).
    * OIDC for Actions → AWS deploy.
    * Budget alarms.
12) Security basics
* Secrets via Kubernetes Secrets (core) → SOPS/Vault (stretch).
* Image scan (Trivy). SBOM.
* Pod security: runAsNonRoot, readOnlyRootFS, resource limits.
* Minimal IAM if on cloud.
13) Tests
* Unit: domain logic, price gen, risk checks.
* Integration: DB + queue with Testcontainers.
* e2e: k6 load test hitting /orders and /positions.
* Gate: PR must pass unit+integration; main runs e2e nightly.
14) Demo script
1. make cluster-up && make deploy
2. Open Grafana dashboard.
3. make load starts a k6 script to post orders at N RPS.
4. Show HPA scaling.
5. Kill a pod. Show zero-downtime and error rate stability.
6. Show alerts firing to a webhook (e.g., Slack).
15) Stretch features (pick 2–3)
* Kafka/NATS replacing Redis Streams. Add consumer group lag metric.
* Risk checks: max notional per symbol, reject with 422 and metric.
* Canary: Argo Rollouts with success metrics.
* SLOs: 99.9% success over 30d; error budget burn alerts.
* GitOps: Argo CD + app-of-apps.
* Perf: pprof (Go) or py-spy docs.
* Policy: OPA Gatekeeper constraints.
16) Deliverables checklist
* README with:
    * What it is. Architecture diagram. Quickstart. Demo GIF. Cost notes.
    * “Why this matters for platform/SRE roles.”
* /dashboards/grafana.json and screenshots.
* /ops/runbooks/{db-lag.md,pod-crashloop.md,high-latency.md}.
* One 5–7 min Loom walkthrough.
* A short blog post or LinkedIn write-up linking repo and Loom.
17) 10-day build schedule
* Day 1–2: API skeleton, DB, metrics, health, Dockerfile.
* Day 3: Queue + worker. Price feed. Local end-to-end.
* Day 4: CI pipeline. Tests to 80%+.
* Day 5: Helm chart. k3d deploy. Prometheus + Grafana.
* Day 6: Alerts + Loki. HPA + PDB. Runbooks v1.
* Day 7: e2e load test (k6). Fix perf. README quickstart.
* Day 8: Stretch 1 (e.g., risk checks). Dashboard polish.
* Day 9: Stretch 2 (e.g., canary). Security hardening.
* Day 10: Loom + screenshots + blog draft.
18) Acceptance criteria
* make up brings a working stack locally.
* POST /orders produces fills and moves the queue.
* Grafana shows traffic and latency under load. Alerts trigger.
* CI green on PR. CD deploys on main.
* README-only setup succeeds for a fresh user.
If you want, I’ll generate the repo skeleton, Makefile, Helm chart stubs, GitHub Actions YAML, and a k6 script next.
